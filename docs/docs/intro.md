# Welcome to Miren

**Miren** is a modern infrastructure platform built for small teams doing big things. Deploy, observe, and scale without bureaucracy or burnout.

## What is Miren?

Miren gives you the power of a full platform team without the overhead, complexity, or cost:

- **Deploy Instantly**: Ship code from CLI to production in seconds. No YAML, no pipelines, no waiting.
- **Team Management Made Easy**: Cloud authentication built in. Add teammates, manage access, and control permissions without rolling your own auth.
- **Safe Data**: Data created by your services is automatically backed up to miren.cloud, giving you peace of mind.
- **Workflows With Taste**: Great workflows out of the box. Opinionated, battle-tested practices that just work from day one.
- **Unified Tooling**: Same workflows everywhere — local, staging, and production. Consistent tools and commands across all environments.
