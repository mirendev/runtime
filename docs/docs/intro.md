# Welcome to Miren

**Miren** is a modern infrastructure platform built for small teams doing big things. Deploy, observe, and scale without bureaucracy or burnout.

## What is Miren?

Miren gives you the power of a full platform team without the overhead, complexity, or cost:

- **Deploy Instantly**: Ship code from CLI to production in seconds. No YAML, no pipelines, no waiting.
- **Team Management Made Easy**: Cloud authentication built in. Add teammates, manage access, and control permissions without rolling your own auth.
- **Safe Data**: Data created by your services is automatically backed up to miren.cloud, giving you peace of mind.
- **Workflows With Taste**: Great workflows out of the box. Opinionated, battle-tested practices that just work from day one.
- **Unified Tooling**: Same workflows everywhere — local, staging, and production. Consistent tools and commands across all environments.

## Quick Start

Get started with Miren in seconds:

```bash
# Install Miren
curl -fsSL https://miren.cloud/install | sudo bash

# Deploy your first app
miren deploy

# Check app status
miren app list

# View logs
miren logs
```

## Key Concepts

- **Apps**: Your applications, each containing one or more services
- **Services**: Processes within an app — web servers, workers, databases
- **Scaling**: Automatic instance scaling based on traffic, or fixed instance counts
- **Deploy**: Push code to any environment with a single command
- **Environments**: Local, staging, production — all work the same way
- **Teams**: Manage who can access what, all through miren.cloud
